						<p> Japan is a country that remained completely blocked off to any foreigner until the 1500s, when missionaries and traders started to arrive from Europe. At that time, Japan was ruled by the shogun, warlords who were supposed to respect the Emperor. The most famous shogun is Tokugawa Ieyasu, who united most of the country and clarified the classes, as well as subordinated the warlords (daimyo). He further established his reign in Edo (modern Tokyo), purposefully away from the Emperor in Kyoto.

						Due to the spread of Christianity in the South of Japan, the Tokugawa shogun evicted all foreigners who refused to disassociate religion from trade â€“ this meant everyone but the Dutch left, and even then, their base was a man-made island off the port of Nagasaki. Travelling abroad was also forbidden to the Japanese. The Tokugawa clan held on to power until the 1868 Meiji Restoration, at which point the power was restored to the Emperor, who moved to Tokyo. At this point in time, the Western powers decided to force the Japanese to start trading again, by using highly intimidating American war ships. A period of Western integration followed, during which the Japanese government did all to modernise, revising their education system, military, law and many more. 1945 is the turning point in Japanese history, and has shaped the entire government and international policy since. The occupation of Japan, the rewriting of their Constitution by a team of foreigners and the removal of their army.

						Since then, Japan's economy has gone through the roof, to place it second in the world. </p>
